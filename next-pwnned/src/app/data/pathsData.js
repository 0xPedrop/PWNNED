          "Understanding XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) Fundamentals is crucial in web security as it involves attackers injecting malicious scripts into websites viewed by other users. These scripts can steal sensitive information like login credentials and cookies, deface websites, or redirect users to malicious sites. Recognizing the different types of XSS, such as reflected, stored, and DOM-based, along with common injection points and the underlying mechanisms, forms the bedrock for implementing effective preventative measures and mitigating potential vulnerabilities in web applications.",
